## 👋 Hi, I’m Chengyu!

I'm a full-stack software engineer combining a background in marketing 
analytics with a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. The journey has given me a rare mix of user insight, data architecture, and technical precision.

Since graduating, I've built full-stack applications that integrate search, information retrieval, and LLM-powered features. My work spans the entire stack: from designing databases and data pipelines to building APIs and frontend interfaces.

Currently working on an AI agent-driven NPC simulation platform, combining game design and generative AI, creating dynamic, human-like character interactions. 👉 [About this Project](caerulean.md)
